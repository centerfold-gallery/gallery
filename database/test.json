My art finds strength and humanity in the most difficult places. I have worked in Haiti, Afghanistan, South Thailand, Iraq, Iran, Democratic Republic of Congo and many more countries who struggle for liberty and freedom of speech.  And so, I create narratives and stories in order to provide visibility for human rights.  \n\nFor over a decade I have created works of art, in relation to violence, human crises, and social upheavals. These work have gained recognition through multiple awards and solo exhibitions, as well as a major solo exhibition at the museum of Fine Arts in Montreal.\nAs a war artist, I am presently banned from my own native country of Iran with a Fatwa (bounty) on my life. By embracing this risk, \nI recognize the mission to support and create visibility for the unheard voices of the world. \n\nI arrived in Canada as a child refugee.  Living and seeing violence on a daily basis has become a norm and almost a fascination. \nI have then researched to find logic and humanity in the face of violence. And so, my life goal has been to bring an understanding to those who struggle to see beyond the horror and adversity of it. Therefore, my art brings forth human struggles, exposes it in full view, and aspires to evoke hope.",

   "Artist Statement": "As an artist, my main purpose is to create art that supports suppressed communities and creates a voice for them. My art finds strength and humanity in the most difficult places. I have worked in Haiti, Afghanistan, South Thailand, Iraq, Iran, Democratic Republic of Congo and many more countries who struggle for liberty and freedom of speech.  And so, I create narratives and stories in order to provide visibility for human rights.  \n\nFor over a decade I have created works of art, in relation to violence, human crises, and social upheavals. These work have gained recognition through multiple awards and solo exhibitions, as well as a major solo exhibition at the museum of Fine Arts in Montreal.\nAs a war artist, I am presently banned from my own native country of Iran with a Fatwa (bounty) on my life. By embracing this risk, \nI recognize the mission to support and create visibility for the unheard voices of the world. \n\nI arrived in Canada as a child refugee.  Living and seeing violence on a daily basis has become a norm and almost a fascination. \nI have then researched to find logic and humanity in the face of violence. And so, my life goal has been to bring an understanding to those who struggle to see beyond the horror and adversity of it. Therefore, my art brings forth human struggles, exposes it in full view, and aspires to evoke hope.",

   "Artist Statement": "As an artist, my main purpose is to create art that supports suppressed communities and creates a voice for them. My art finds strength and humanity in the most difficult places. I have worked in Haiti, Afghanistan, South Thailand, Iraq, Iran, Democratic Republic of Congo and many more countries who struggle for liberty and freedom of speech.  And so, I create narratives and stories in order to provide visibility for human rights.  \n\nFor over a decade I have created works of art, in relation to violence, human crises, and social upheavals. These work have gained recognition through multiple awards and solo exhibitions, as well as a major solo exhibition at the museum of Fine Arts in Montreal.\nAs a war artist, I am presently banned from my own native country of Iran with a Fatwa (bounty) on my life. By embracing this risk, \nI recognize the mission to support and create visibility for the unheard voices of the world. \n\nI arrived in Canada as a child refugee.  Living and seeing violence on a daily basis has become a norm and almost a fascination. \nI have then researched to find logic and humanity in the face of violence. And so, my life goal has been to bring an understanding to those who struggle to see beyond the horror and adversity of it. Therefore, my art brings forth human struggles, exposes it in full view, and aspires to evoke hope.",

   "Artist Statement": "Je n�۪ai jamais vu mon propre visage.\nJ�۪ai vu ma r̩flexion. J�۪ai vu mon image. J�۪ai vu autrui. Je vois mon visage par d̩doublement.  \n\nMon apparence, telle que les autres la per̤oit, ̩troitement li̩e �� mon identit̩,  m�۪est inaccessible. \nUne r̩alit̩ fuyante et glissante. \n��When you photograph a splash, you�۪re freezing a moment and it becomes something else.  I realize that a splash could never be seen this way in real life.�۝ \nDavid Hockney ",
