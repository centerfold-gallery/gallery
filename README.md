The website and gallery for Centerfold.

## Installation

You'll need the config.json file for API keys. This file should not be in version control, since our repository is public. We could make the repo private, then version control the config.json.

Nextm,simply use:

```console
$ npm install
$ node index.js
```

At this point you will have a local server running on port 3000. View it at http://localhost:3000/
