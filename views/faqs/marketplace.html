						I am hesitant to buy an artwork without seeing it in person. Can I schedule a viewing?
					</div>
					<div class="faqs-answer">
						Seeing and experiencing an artwork in person can be a decisive step in the acquisition process. In most cases, we are happy to coordinate a visit for you to view an artwork in person, in Montreal and Toronto. In some cases (such as when the artist has elected to hold and ship the artwork themselves), we may be able to schedule a studio visit for you. Please email us as <a href="mailto:support@centerfold.gallery?subject=I would like to view an artwork in person" target="_blank" class="inline-link">support@centerfold.gallery</a> to schedule a viewing.<br/>
						<br/>
						For prospective buyers located outside of Montreal and Toronto, we would happy to provide you with hi-resolution images and/or videos of artworks under consideration in order to better visualize the piece. If you would like to send us a picture of a space you invision putting your artwork in, please let us know, and we will send you a mockup of the artwork, to scale, in your space. We are working on an AR app to better facilitate this process in the future.<br/>
						<br/>
						To request hi-resolution images, videos, or a mockup, please send us an email at <a href="mailto:support@centerfold.gallery?subject=I would like hi-res images, videos, and a mockup of an artwork in my space" target="_blank" class="inline-link">support@centerfold.gallery</a>.
