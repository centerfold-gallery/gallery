					</div>
					<div class="faqs-answer">
						You are responsible for all your activity on the website. If you do bad things we may terminate any agreements we have with you, and remove your content from the website without any notice. For starters:<br/>
						<br/>
						‚Ä¢	Illegal Activities - Don't break the law or encourage others to break the law.<br/>
						‚Ä¢	Abuse - Don't harass or bully others, or promote violence or hatred towards others.<br/>
						‚Ä¢	Personal Information - Don't distribute others' personal information or otherwise abuse it. Creators with access to their supporter's personal information should not use it for anything unrelated to Centerfold.<br/>
						‚Ä¢	Fraud - Don't post information that is false or otherwise misleading.<br/>
						‚Ä¢	Impersonation - Don't impersonate anyone.<br/>
						‚Ä¢	Intellectual Property - Don't infringe on others' intellectual property rights.<br/>
						‚Ä¢	Malware -  Don't use Centerfold to host or distribute, malicious or destructive software.<br/>
						‚Ä¢	Endorsement - Don't claim endorsement by Centerfold without our prior written approval.<br/>
						‚Ä¢	Service Degradation - Don't degrade others' use of Centerfold.<br/>
						‚Ä¢	Data Mining - Don't crawl, scrape or otherwise index information on Centerfold. If you are doing this to create a useful feature then we may allow it, but you must check with us first.<br/>
						‚Ä¢	Reverse Engineering - Don't take apart Centerfold to figure out how we do what we do.<br/>
						‚Ä¢   Authenticity and Copyright Infringement - As an artist, you may not post content that infringes on others' intellectual property rights. You cannot pretend or impersonate another artist, such as using someone else's name, brand, or artwork in order to raise funds. We will review satire and comedy in a different way as we believe these subgenres are original content.<br/>
						‚Ä¢	Adult Content - We have zero tolerance when it comes to the glorification of sexual violence which includes bestiality, rape, and child exploitation (i.e., sexualized depiction of minors). This is true for illustrated, animated, or any other type of content. Centerfold reserves the right to review and remove accounts that may violate this guideline. As a reminder, you should never post or share nude content of any individual under the age of 18, including yourself. As a strong commitment to child safety, we will work with law enforcement whenever we come across child exploitation.<br/>
						‚Ä¢	We also do not allow any work featuring necrophilia, or fetish content that is hard to distinguish from non-consensual sex.<br/>
						‚Ä¢ You cannot arrange sexual service(s) as a reward for your supporters.</br>
						‚Ä¢ Lastly, while we strive to keep Centerfold a platform where art can exist free of censorship, we reserve the right to remove content we deem inappropriate at our own discretion.</br>
						‚Ä¢	Violence - After creating a Centerfold page, any artist caught in the act or convicted of making credible violent threats, committing violent crimes, child abuse, malicious doxing, coordinating nonviolent harm (such as fraud, money laundering and gambling), or encouraging others to do any of these activities, may be banned from using Centerfold.</br>
						‚Ä¢	Dangerous Organizations - People with a dangerous criminal history or a known affiliation with violent or dangerous groups (including terrorist or cyber terrorist organizations, organized criminal groups, and violent hate groups), cannot receive funds through Centerfold, no matter the purpose or apparent intention of their Centerfold page.</br>
						‚Ä¢	Harmful or Dangerous Activity ‚Äì We don't allow funds to be collected for anything that facilitates harmful or illegal activities. You cannot post content that advocates, threatens or shows you causing harm to yourself or other people, as well as animals. In the same line as violent and harmful activities, you cannot promote illegal activities, such as property crime, distribution of illegal weapons, or drug manufacturing.</br>
						‚Ä¢	Self Harm ‚Äì We don't allow any page that promotes or glorifies self-harm, such as pages that encourage self-injury, suicide, or an eating disorder. Examples include pages that glorify self-scarification or a pro-anorexia campaign. If we believe there's a credible risk the creator will harm themselves, we will work with law enforcement when needed. However, We allow content that promotes awareness such as self-harm survival stories, especially if they have educational value.</br>
						If you or someone close to you might be in danger of hurting themselves, please contact local authorities or seek help:
						<a href="http://www.suicide.org/suicide-hotlines.html" target="_blank" class="inline-link">List of Suicide Hotlines</a></br>
						‚Ä¢	Spam - While it can be hard to grow your patronage, no one likes being spammed. These are some of the actions we consider to be spamming, which is prohibited on Centerfold.</br>
							- Don't create voting schemes; don't contact other artists to have a vote-for-a-vote kind of trade deal.</br>
							- Don't use Centerfold to release or link to malware or phishing content.</br>
							- Don't create Bots.</br>
						‚Ä¢	Doxing - We take a strong stance against doxing because it is used to silence or intimidate people with different viewpoints on the internet. It can cause extensive emotional trauma and can put the victim's physical safety at risk. The most classic form of doxing is when an individual's private personal information is shared. This could be information such as a phone number or home address. The definition of private personal information can vary and may mean that it is simply very difficult to find. We also consider it to be doxing when an individual's non-private information is aggregated. For example, we would consider it doxing if someone's profile picture was combined with their real name, all of their known social media accounts, and the city they lived in. No matter the specific information shared, we also evaluate the context around why it was shared. If it looks like this information is being shared for the purpose of making it easier for a large group to harass that individual, we are likely to consider it doxing. When doxing takes place, we lose the ability to have conversations. Doxing isn't speech countering speech, it is speech shutting down others' ability to speak. It removes our ability to discuss ideas, grow as individuals and have a safe space for disagreement.<br/>
						<br/>
						These guidelines are not meant to be exhaustive. If you find a new and creative way to hurt Centerfold or our users we may take action to prevent it.

					<div class="faqs-question">
						All About Being an Artist
					</div>
					<div class="faqs-answer">
						There are two types of Artist accounts:<br/>
						<br/>
						The first is the Centerfold Series Artist account. These artists are featured in exhibitions that allow friends, family, and followers to support them by paying a fee to enter the exhibition and voting for artists in each cohort. You appoint us as your agent to collect and process payments on your behalf, and we will not take any fee for this. You are responsible for any taxes you owe based on the payments you receive. If your artwork sells, you agree to allow us to take 5% of the sale price and add it to the exhibitions fees collected to be distributed among all the artists in your cohort (including yourself).<br/>
						In connection with our charges to supporters, you appoint us as your limited agent for the sole purpose of receiving, holding, and settling payments to you. As your agent, our receipt of funds from a supporter on your behalf is the same as receipt of funds by you directly, and you will only have recourse against us, and not against any supporter, for any failure by us to settle funds to you. We try to provide timely access to your funds, but you may occasionally experience delays in accessing your funds. We may also block or hold payments for violations of the terms or compliance reasons. When payments are delayed or blocked we try to communicate the reasons to you promptly. In order to protect artists, we may block supporters' payments if we believe them to be fraudulent.<br/>
						<br/>
						The second type of account is for Artists selling work through Centerfold's marketplace These artists have profile pages with their work and a bio. You appoint us as your agent to collect and process payments on your behalf, and we will charge a 25% commission on any sales that occur through the marketplace. For more information on this, please refer to our artist contract.<br/>
						In connection with our charges to buyers, you appoint us as your limited agent for the sole purpose of receiving, holding, and settling payments to you. As your agent, our receipt of funds from a buyer on your behalf is the same as receipt of funds by you directly, and you will only have recourse against us, and not against any supporter, for any failure by us to settle funds to you. We try to provide timely access to your funds, but you may occasionally experience delays in accessing your funds. We may also block or hold payments for violations of the terms or compliance reasons, including a failure by you to respond in a timely manner to any sales processed through marketplace. When payments are delayed or blocked we try to communicate the reasons to you promptly. In order to protect artists, we may block buyers' payments if we believe them to be fraudulent. You are responsible for paying all taxes.<br/>
						<br/>
						We restrict some types of content. You cannot:<br/>
						<br/>
						‚Ä¢	Create content using others' intellectual property, unless you have written permission to use it, or your use is protected by fair use.<br/>
						<br/>
						Please also see our community guidelines for specific guidance in some of these areas.<br/>
						We are not party to the agreement between artists and supporters, or artists and buyers.

					<div class="faqs-answer">
						We only provide a platform for artists, supporters, and buyers to interact. If you see content that violates these terms, then let us know and we may remove it.<br/>
						Removing content or terminating agreements with artists is not an action we take lightly and we may take a while to investigate or open the issue up to further discussion with the community.<br/>
						We are constantly testing out new features with the goal of making Centerfold better. We may add or remove features, and often test features with a random subset of our users. If we believe a feature is significantly different from these terms, then we explain those differences in the test.<br/>
