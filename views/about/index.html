						Centerfold began as an idea to enable artists' endeavours by putting money into their pockets. This core idea flourished into a series of offline pop-up exhibitions that crowd-sourced funds for those featured. After charitably raising over $15,000 for local artists, we sought to expand our modelâ€™s reach, and brought the series model online.<br/>

						How it works is simple; visitors pay a fee to view the exhibition and have a chance to vote for their 3 favourite artists on display. 100% of the revenue from the exhibition is distributed back to the artists based on the percentage of votes that they receive.

	                    In addition to the series, Centerfold hosts an online art marketplace that presents some of the best artwork from both emerging and established artists across the globe. Moreover, the Centerfold marketplace has a 3D functionality that replicates the experience of visiting a physical gallery. As a result, the gallery experience is brought into the comfort of our visitors' homes.
