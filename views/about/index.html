                    Centerfold began as an idea to enable artists' endeavours by putting money in the pockets of artists. This idea flourished into a series of offline pop-up exhibitions that crowd-sourced funds for the featured artists. After charitably raising $15,000 for local artists, we decided to bring the series online. How it works is simple; visitors pay a fee to view the exhibition and have a chance to vote for their 3 favourite artists on display.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    100% of the revenue from the exhibition is distributed back to the artists based on the percentage of votes they receive.

                    Along with the series, Centerfold operates an online art marketplace that presents some of the best artwork from emerging and established artists. Our 3D functionality replicates the experience of being in a physical gallery, and as a result, brings the gallery experience into the comfort of our visitors' homes.
